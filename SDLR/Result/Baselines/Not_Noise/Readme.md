Here is The performance of baseline methods that each directories named after them.

The results of their performance are on MQ2007, MQ2008, MSLR10K, MSLR30K, Yahoo!Set1, and Yahoo!Set2 dataset with metrics of NDCG and MRR at 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 10th, 20th positions.

Two tabels below that come from the paper, are comparing our proposed method and baseline methods.

Table 1. Performance of the SDLR learning to rank framework over MQ2007, MQ2008, and MSLR10K datasets in terms of NDCG and MRR in positions 1, 3, 5, 10, and 20. Baselines that have not reported results over these dataset are excluded from this table. The bold number is the highest one in each column.

Table 2. Performance of the SDLR learning to rank framework over MSLR30K, Yahoo!Set1 and Yahoo!Set2 datasets in terms of NDCG and MRR in positions 1, 3, 5, 10, and 20. The bold number is the highest one in each column. Baselines that have not reported results over these dataset are excluded from this table. Non-reported results for some measures are marked with -.
