The performance measurement of implementing different baseline methods are reported here that directories named after each baseline methods.

 Each directory contains of 6 tabular files that shows the results of <b>MQ2007</b>, <b>MQ2008</b>, <b>MSLR10K</b>, <b>MSLR30K</b>, <b>Yahoo!Set1</b>, and <b>Yahoo!Set2</b> with metrics of <b>NDCG</b> and <b>MRR</b> at 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 10th, 20th positions.

 Also, A brief preview of them is showed in table below.

Table 6. Performance of SDLR and the baselines over noisy datasets. Noises are sampled from a normal
distribution (𝜇 = 0, 𝜎 = 0.05), independently for each feature.
