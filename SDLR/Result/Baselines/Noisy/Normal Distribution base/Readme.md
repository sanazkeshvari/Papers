The performance measurement of implementing different baseline methods are reported here that directories named after each baseline methods.
\n
 Each directory contains of 6 tabular files that shows the results of MQ2007, MQ2008, MSLR10K, MSLR30K, Yahoo!Set1, and Yahoo!Set2 with metrics of NDCG and MRR at 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 10th, 20th positions.

 Also, A brief preview of them is showed in table below.

Table 6. Performance of SDLR and the baselines over noisy datasets. Noises are sampled from a normal
distribution (𝜇 = 0, 𝜎 = 0.05), independently for each feature.
