The performance of different baseline methods is showed in directories with their name which have feature-based noise that came from normal distribution noise with mean of 0 and variance of each feature's variance. 

Each directory contains of 6 tabular files that shows the results of <b>MQ2007</b>, <b>MQ2008</b>, <b>MSLR10K</b>, <b>MSLR30K</b>, <b>Yahoo!Set1</b>, and <b>Yahoo!Set2</b> with metrics of <b>NDCG</b> and <b>MRR</b> at 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 10th, 20th positions.

Also, A brief preview of them compared with SDLR is showed in table below.

Table 7. Performance of SDLR and other baselines over noisy datasets. For each feature, noises are sample from a normal distribution whose 𝜇 and 𝜎 are estimated based on the feature’s values.
