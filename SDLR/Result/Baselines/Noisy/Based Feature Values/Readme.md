The performance of different baseline methods is showed in directories with their name which have feature-based noise that came from normal distribution noise with mean of 0 and variance of each feature's variance. 

Each directory contains of 6 tabular files that shows the results of MQ2007, MQ2008, MSLR10K, MSLR30K, Yahoo!Set1, and Yahoo!Set2 with metrics of NDCG and MRR at 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 10th, 20th positions.

Also, A brief preview of them compared with our method is showed in table below.

Table 7. Performance of SDLR and other baselines over noisy datasets. For each feature, noises are sample from a normal distribution whose 𝜇 and 𝜎 are estimated based on the feature’s values.
