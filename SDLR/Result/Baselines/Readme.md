We compare our learning to rank framework with a number of prominent and state-of-the-art baselines namely ListNet [58 ], ListMLE, ApproxNDCG [ 45], XE𝑛𝑑𝑐𝑔MART [2 ], SetRank[ 38], OrdinalRank [41 ], and NeuralNDCG [ 42]. We also included baselines that adopt knowledge distillation approach in learning to rank models, namely RankDistil [50 ] and SDR [47 ], and baselines that target training generalizable models: ListMAP [25 ], SOUR [ 33], and Sigmoid-Loss.
