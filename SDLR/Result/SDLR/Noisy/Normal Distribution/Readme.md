The performance of using SDLR in front of noisy data which came from normal distribution noise with mean of 0 and variance of 3 various value is examined that contains of:

1. variance equals to 0.01 in `1%` directory.
2. variance equals to 0.03 in `3%` directory.
3. variance equals to 0.05 in `5%` directory.

The NDCG and MRR on 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 10th, and 20th positions is reported from student phase (The distribution bandwidth as the knowledge is transfered from teacher phase).

the comparison between SDLR and other methods in these experiments is showed in table below that received from the paper.

Table 5. Performance of SDLR over noisy data with varying levels of noise. Performance is measured in terms
of MRR@10. Noises are samples from normal distributions with ùúá = 0, and ùúé =0.1, 0.3, and 0.5.
