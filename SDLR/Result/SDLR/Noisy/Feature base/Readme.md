The performance of SDLR is reported here in face of feature-based noise that came from normal distribution noise with mean of 0 and variance of each feature's variance.

The results received from student phase with <b>NDCG</b> and <b>MRR</b> exist in `Student` (The distribution bandwidth as the knowledge is transfered from teacher phase).

the comparison between SDLR and other methods is showed in table below that referenced from the paper.

Table 7. Performance of SDLR and other baselines over noisy datasets. For each feature, noises are sample from a normal distribution whose 𝜇 and 𝜎 are estimated based on the feature’s values.
