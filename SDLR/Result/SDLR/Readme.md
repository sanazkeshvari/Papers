Data are reported in Noisy and Non-Noisy settings.

Two different noise settings are reported:
<ul>
  <li>Mean=0 and  variance=0.05 In `Normal Distribution`.</li>
  <li>Mean=0 and  variance= each feature's variance In `Feature base`.</li>
</ul>


Three different Non-Noisy are reported: settings as below:

    Data were split with different ratios between the teacher and student in 'Different ratio of Data'.
    All data were provided only to the teacher phase (there is no student phase) in 'Teacher Only'.
    Both teacher and student were trained on all the data in 'Train over 100% of training data'.
