The results include three different settings as below:

    Data were split with different ratios between the teacher and student in 'Different ratio of Data'.
    All data were provided only to the teacher phase (there is no student phase) in 'Teacher Only'.
    Both teacher and student were trained on all the data in 'Train over 100% of training data'.
