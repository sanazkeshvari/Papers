Fig. 5. nDCGs and MRRs achieved by the teacher component of SDLR, denoted as SDLR-T-Only, over the MQ2007 and MQ2008 datasets; compared with the performance of SDLR. Here, SDLR-T-Only is trained with 100% of the training data, while SDLR uses 80% of the training data in the teaching phase and remaining 20%
in the student phase.
