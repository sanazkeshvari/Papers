# The Median Loss Function

In this paper, the loss functions defined by the ln cosh(x) which can be used to determine both soft and hard median through the adjustment of its parameters. 
The suggested approach discusses the relationship between this nonlinear function and reducing predicted loss which is used in robust adaptive
filters, the relationship between the median loss function and the median filter is highlighted in our research.
Our work is essential, and the obtained results are important.
